                <h2>Thanks for your visit</h2>
                <!-- <p>i had made some apps to prove my capablities</p> -->

                    <!-- <p>some of them i had made during the last year and other i had built this year or they still under development</p> -->
                    <p>I had worked during my first school year in a project about turning sewage water into drinkable water</p>
                    <p>I had worked on my own like collecting the pieces of a puzzle to find the answer i kept consultating the professors at Asyut university (from science and physics faculty) about every piece of the project and kept doing experiments about every part</p>
                    <p>unfortunately due to to lack of equipment and materials i had to stop and wait until i got the material and the opprtuinities becasue i was going nowhere so i started to search for the local materials to try to utillize them in my search and then i got introduced to computers and how they may be used to help in scientific research so i started to learn programming and kept learning but still waiting to get back to my work</p>
                    <p>A nice thing: one day I had asked a professor about what should I do next he said go and get a patent for your work and wait until you get the equipment that you need, that's surprised me how people look at scientific research in my country.</p>
                    <p>So i am currently trying to apply to get a patent from my for my work</p>

                    <h4>what i done after</h4>
                    <p>since i found that there is no way i could continue my research i started to work with the available which was computers i learned how to program and i am still looking forward to keep learning this becasue i want to want to combine computers with what i do in research so i can be more effective in what i am doing and that's why i am applying to computer science because i want to master the skill before going back to my research</p>

                    <h4>i had made some progress in this field what so every and here is some of my work</h4>

                <div class="section">

              <div class="section" id="school-website">
                <h2>School website</h2>
                <p>i had also been chosen to made the school website during my third grade, i had constructed the app with under the eyes of the Head Master and my computer science teacher mr osama ghandour</p>
                <p>my part in it was to build the backend portion of it and also provide assistant in building the front-end</p>

              <div class="section" id="social">
                <h2 >Social</h2>
                <p>the idea behind that website come from one of the people that i like the most <a href="" onclick="window.open('https://www.google.com/search?q=Aaron+Swartz')">Aaron Swartz</a> </p>
