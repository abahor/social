                <h2>Thanks for your visit</h2>
                <p>I had made some apps through my journey in programming.</p>

                    <p>Some of them I had made during the last year and other I had built this year or they still under development</p>

                </p>
                <!--<p style="color:red">some of them is under maintain so if you see a bug report it <a href="/report_bug">here</a></p>-->
                <div class="section">
                  <h2>Projects</h2>
                  <ul class="simple">
                    <li><a href="#school-website">School Website</a></li>

                  </ul>

                </div>

            <p>I had also made some projects during my school years in Assuit stem in the capstones but I don't consider them relevant to my major except the last semester which was a web app for unemployment to whom who may concern here.</p>
                <p>It is no longer up but I will upload it to a Github repository.</p>

              </div>

              <div class="section" id="school-website">
                <h2>School website</h2>
                <p>I had also been chosen to make the school website during my third grade, I had constructed the app under the supervision of the Head Master and my computer science teacher Mr. Osama Ghandour.</p>

              </div>
              <div class="section" id="social">
                <h2 >Social</h2>
                <p>The idea behind that website comes from one of the people that I like the most <a href="#" onclick="window.open('https://www.google.com/search?q=Aaron+Swartz')">Aaron Swartz</a> </p>
                <div class="highlight-default notranslate">
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <pre style="height:fit-content;">
                        <p class="" style="margin: 0;float:left">"everyone can talk now but the issue is who gets heard"</p>
                        <p style="float:right;margin:0">Aaron Swartz</p>
                    </pre>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>So this website is based on this idea that no matter where you are in the world you can still get heard and that attention is distributed equally among all people</p>
                <p>you can click <a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://abahor.pythonanywhere.com')">here</a> to visit the website</p>
                <p>If you face any troubles you may need to refresh the website page</p>
